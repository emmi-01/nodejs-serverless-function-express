##  Simple Vercel API Handler

This project demonstrates a basic API endpoint using the Vercel serverless platform. The code implements a simple handler that returns a greeting message based on the user's input.

### Project Structure

The project contains a single file:

* **index.ts:** Contains the API handler code.

### Functionality

* **API Endpoint:**  The `handler` function acts as the API endpoint.
* **Request Handling:** It extracts the `name` query parameter from the incoming request. If no `name` is provided, it defaults to "World".
* **Response Generation:** It constructs a JSON response containing a greeting message using the provided name.

### Running the Application

This code is designed to be deployed on Vercel. Follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. **Create a Vercel project:**
    * If you don't have an existing Vercel project, visit [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/) and create a new project.
2. **Upload the code:**
    * Upload the `index.ts` file to the project's root directory.
3. **Deploy the project:**
    * Use the Vercel CLI or the Vercel dashboard to deploy the project.

Once deployed, you can access the API endpoint at the URL provided by Vercel.

### Using the API

To call the API, you can make a GET request to the endpoint with the `name` query parameter:

* **Example:** `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app?name=John`

This will return the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello John!"
}
```

### Further Development

This is a simple example; you can extend it to implement more complex API functionality, including:

* **Data Retrieval:** Fetch data from a database or external API.
* **Data Manipulation:**  Perform operations on data, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.
* **Authentication:** Implement authentication mechanisms to protect your API.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to provide informative error responses.

This README provides a basic overview of the project. Further documentation for specific functionalities or additional features can be added as needed.
